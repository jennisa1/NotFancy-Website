      <h2>Recipe (Serving Size: 1)</h2>
      <ol>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <li>Before turning on the stove, sprinkle 1 tsp of rosemary on the fry pan followed by 3 tbsp of olive oil.
        Spread oil to cover bottom of frying pan. 
          <i>Tip</i>: If pan is drenched with too much oil, take a paper towel and press some oil out of pan.</li>
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <li>Crack 1 egg on frying pan.</li>
        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <li>Proceed to turn on stove on maximum heat and let egg cook.</li>
        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <li>As egg begins to cook, sprinkle a light dusting of garlic powder on top.
          <i>Tip</i>: Great for those who are not fond of the egg yoke taste or the standalone flavor of eggs in general.</li>
        <h3>Step 5</h3>
        <li>Once the egg is cooked (indicated by lack of runny-ness and firm shape), turn off the stove and flip egg over.
        This is to ensure no sides of the egg will be burnt.</li>
        <h3>Step 6</h3>
        <li>Keep the frying pan on the stove despite it being off. Flip egg over after 1-2 minutes. Egg white should be
        semi-glossy and yoke should be cooked and flattened. No burned edges or burned yoke should be present.</li>
        <h3>Step 7</h3>
        <li>Serve on a plate and enjoy!</li>
      </ol>
