      <h3>Serving Size: 1</h3>
      <ol>
        <h4>Step 1</h4>
        <li>Before turning on the stove, sprinkle 1 tsp of rosemary on the fry pan followed by 3 tbsp of olive oil.</li>
        <h4>Step 2</h4>
        <li>Crack 1 egg on the frying pan.</li>
        <h4>Step 3</h4>
        <li>Proceed to turn on stove on maximum heat and let egg cook.</li>
        <h4>Step 4</h4>
        <li>As egg begins to cook, sprinkle a light dusting of garlic powder on top, This is a great tip if you are not 
        fond of the egg yoke taste or the standalone flavor of eggs in general.</li>
        <h4>Step 5</h4>
        <li>Once the egg is cooked (indicated by lack of runny-ness and firm shape), turn off the stove and flip egg over.
        This is to ensure no sides of the egg will be burnt.</li>
        <h4>Step 6</h4>
        <li>Keep the frying pan on the stove despite it being off. Flip egg over after 1-3 minutes to check if both sides
        are cooked to your liking.</li>
        <h4>Step 7</h4>
        <li>Serve on a plate and enjoy!</li>
