      <h2>Recipe (Serving Size: 1)</h2>
      <ol>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <li>Before turning on the stove, sprinkle 1 tsp of rosemary on the fry pan followed by 3 tbsp of olive oil.
        Spread oil to cover bottom of frying pan. 
          <i>Tip</i>: If there is too much oil on the pan, take a paper towel and dab excess off.</li>
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <li>Crack 1 egg on the frying pan.</li>
        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <li>Proceed to turn on the stove on maximum heat. The egg will now begin to cook.</li>
        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <li>Sprinkle a light dusting of garlic powder as the egg is cooking.
          <i>Tip</i>: Using garlic powder helps to mask the organic flavor of eggs for those who are not fond of 
          that particular taste.</li>
        <h3>Step 5</h3>
        <li>Once the egg is cooked (indicated by lack of runny-ness and firm shape), turn off the stove and flip the 
          egg over.  <i>Tip</i>: Thurning off the stove once one side is cooked prevents either side of the egg from 
          becoming burned.</li>
        <h3>Step 6</h3>
        <li>Keep the frying pan on the stove that has remained off. After 1-1.5 minutes, flip the egg over. The fried
          egg should now be cooked on both sides without any burned center or edges.</li>
        <h3>Step 7</h3>
        <li>Serve on a plate and enjoy!</li>
